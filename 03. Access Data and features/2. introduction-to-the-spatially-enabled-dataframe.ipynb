While the <code>SDF</code> object is still avialable for use, the team has stopped active development of it and is promoting the use of this new Spatially Enabled DataFrame pattern. The SEDF provides you better memory management, ability to handle larger datasets and is the pattern that Pandas advocates as the path forward.</blockquote>\n","\n","The Spatially Enabled DataFrame inserts a custom namespace called `spatial` into the popular [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) [DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe) structure to give it spatial abilities. This allows you to use intutive, pandorable operations on both the attribute and spatial columns. Thus, the SEDF is based on data structures inherently suited to data analysis, with natural operations for the filtering and inspecting of subsets of values which are fundamental to statistical and geographic manipulations.\n","\n","The dataframe reads from many **sources**, including shapefiles, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) [DataFrames](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe), feature classes, GeoJSON, and Feature Layers."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This document outlines some fundamentals of using the `Spatially Enabled DataFrame` object for working with GIS data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from arcgis.features import GeoAccessor, GeoSeriesAccessor"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Accessing GIS data\n","GIS users need to work with both published layers on remote servers (web layers) and local data, but the ability to manipulate these datasets without permanently copying the data is lacking.  The `Spatial Enabled DataFrame` solves this problem because it is an in-memory object that can read, write and manipulate geospatial data.\n","\n","The SEDF integrates with Esri's [`ArcPy` site-package](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm) as well as the open source [`pyshp`](https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp/), [`shapely`](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely) and [`fiona`](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona) packages.
