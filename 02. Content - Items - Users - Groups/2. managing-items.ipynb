So, first question to answer is: What does it mean to `clone`? Merriam-Webster defines [`clone`](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cloning) as the action of _\"propagat[ing] a clone from.\"_ (Didn't I hear my 2nd grade teacher - and every teacher after that for that matter - say it's unhelpful to use the word you are defining in its definition?...) Diving further into the definition of a _\"clone\"_, it reads _\"the aggregate of genetically identical cells or organisms asexually produced by or from a single progenitor cell or organism.\"_ Okay, not exactly the context we're working in when discussing a Web GIS. Further along the definition we get to something more along the lines of what we're thinking: _\"one that appears to be a copy of an original form.\"_ BINGO! \n","\n","Leveraging the Python API to clone content from one Web GIS to another can be thought of as _\"propagating content that appears to be a copy of the original content.\"_. Given all the different content and item types, possible Enterprise configurations, potential ArcGIS Online Organization arrangements, security considerations, and item dependencies the [`clone_items()`]((https://developers.arcgis.com/python/api-reference/arcgis.gis.toc.html#arcgis.gis.ContentManager.clone_items)) function aims to _propagate_ an exact duplicate of one item with all its uses and functionality from an original portal to a second portal, but there may be circumstances that lead the clone to come close but not quite produce an identical copy. In addition, the variety of means for publishing items creates varying possibilities for supported, related, or source items created during the publishing process. The relationship between any supported, related, or source items must be considered when cloning an item. For example, the overwrite functionality will not be available on cloned hosted feature layer items, because they do not have a source document from which they were published. The FAQ [here](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/faq.htm#DELETE_SRC) provides important information regarding source items in ArcGIS Online. However, given our education on `cloning`, we now know that cloning an item produces a second item which appears - but may not be identical to the original. It's important to temper expectations when thinking about the Python API `clone_items()` function. There may be times items will not migrate as expected. \n","\n","When talking about cloning items, let's establish some basic terminology.  Cloning can refer to all kinds of transfer, from ArcGIS Enterprise to ArcGIS Online, Enterprise to Enterprise, or ArcGIS Online to Enterprise. (The GIS Community less frequently discusses the need to clone between two distinct ArcGIS Online Organizations, but that is possible as well.) Rather than tangling ourselves up when trying to distinguish between these portal types while writing about them, we'll refer to the portal or organization where the content originates as the _source_ regardless of portal type. We'll consider the portal or organization to which we'll clone content as the _target_. Onward we go!\n","\n","This document illustrates the workflow of gathering _source_ items using a source administrator account, and cloning them into a _target_ administrator account.  More specifically, this guide walks through an approach of cloning data services known as [`hosted feature layers`](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/hosted-web-layers.htm) that are used as building blocks for other Web GIS items, namely [`web maps`](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/core-concepts/web-maps/). `Web Maps` consume these data services as operational layer building blocks. We'll then clone an [`ArcGIS Dashboard`](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/dashboards/get-started/what-is-a-dashboard.htm) and a [`Web Mapping Application`](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/create-map-apps.htm) that each consume a `web map` as part of their definition. For information on each of these item types, please click the hyperlinks for each type.\n","\n","This is an administrator workflow. Using administrator accounts guarantees all necessary privileges within the _source_ to access the item and any dependencies and within the _target_ to create the services and items. The target administrator subsequently can create user accounts and reassign item ownership and/or group membership according to need. This might also be the simplest workflow when the portal has users managed by an external identity store.\n","\n","> **NOTE:** Cloning relies on the sharing model to determine the items any particular [`user`](https://develoipers.arcgis.com/python/api-reference/arcgis.gis.toc.html#user) can clone. If a user can access an item, that user can clone it. However, that user can't create anything in the target portal they don't have the appropriate [`privileges`](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/roles.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_4FF9051EFB814C249AB26B0ACFF7C79F) to create. \n","\n","Any content in any portal must be owned by a [`user`](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/api-reference/arcgis.gis.toc.html#user), so at least one _user_ must exist in the target. If you don't plan on using the administrator accounts in a workflow such as this, you may want to investigate the [`Clone Portal users, groups and content`](../sample-notebooks/clone-portal-users-groups-and-content/#Copy-Users) sample notebook on how to define functions that can copy `user` objects and then clone content using those accounts.
